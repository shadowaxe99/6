1. Scrapy: All the files share the Scrapy framework as a dependency. Scrapy is used for creating the web scraping spiders, handling requests, and processing the scraped data.

2. QuizlitSpider: This is the main spider class defined in "quizlit_spider.py". It contains the logic for scraping the data from Quizlit. This class is used in the Scrapy settings and may be referenced in the pipelines for processing the scraped data.

3. Items: The "items.py" file defines the data schema for the scraped data. This schema is used in the spider to structure the scraped data and in the pipelines to process the data.

4. Pipelines: The "pipelines.py" file defines how the scraped data is processed and stored. The pipelines are used in the Scrapy settings and may reference the items schema.

5. Settings: The "settings.py" file contains the configuration for the Scrapy project. It references the spider and the pipelines.

6. Middlewares: The "middlewares.py" file contains middleware classes for handling requests and responses in Scrapy. These are used in the Scrapy settings.

7. JSON: The scraped data is stored in a structured JSON format. This format is used in the pipelines for storing the data.

8. DOM Elements: The specific DOM elements to be scraped are defined in the spider. These may include the id names of elements, class names, or other selectors.

9. Pagination and Dynamic Content: The spider includes logic for handling pagination and dynamic content on the Quizlit site. This may involve following links to additional pages or handling JavaScript-loaded content.

10. Reddit Data: The specific data to be extracted from Reddit is defined in the spider. This may involve specific selectors or processing logic.
